	\section{Goal}
		\vspace{-3mm}
		\tab \normalsize{In short, we want to be able for the user to manually configure an augmented clock of their own and display it accordingly. Along with this, we would like to see headway made with other features for the application, or dynamic placing of various icons around our clock to indicate the time of day based on the sun's location (e.g. sunrise, sunset, dusk, dawn, etc).}
		

	\section{Task Listing}
		\vspace{-3mm}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item As a user, I want to be able to enter my own values to manually augment the clock and see where the sun is based on the augmented clock (i.e. see what times sunrise, sunset, dusk, dawn occur according to the augmented clock).
			\begin{itemize}
			    \item Task 1: Create an HTML form so that the user can enter their information for the augmented clock (1 hour)
			    \item Task 2: Create a JavaScript function to continually rebuild the clock object on each "submit" of the form (if the user enters invalid input, write JavaScript to inject HTML to prompt a pop-up to the user to tell them that they have input false/no information) (7 hours)
			\end{itemize}
			Total: 8 hours
			\item As a developer, I want to start on the visualization to show the user where the sun is relative to where they are on the Earth.
			\begin{itemize}
			    \item Task 1: Research visualization tools or pluggables that can be used to create this visualization (whether it be d3.js or some other tool). (3 hours)
			    \item Task 2: Start creating the visualization (5 hours)
			\end{itemize}
			Total: 8 hours
			\item As a developer, I want to be able to dynamically change the back- ground based on the current time (so that it reflects the time of day, like night, nadir, et cetera).
			\begin{itemize}
			    \item Task 1: Write a JavaScript function to prompt the user to get their current location (3 hours)
			    \item Task 2: Using the user's location, use the suncalc.js library to find the time of day, based on the sun, and based off of the user's location (e.g. nautical dusk) (6 hours)
			    \item Task 3: Dynamically inject HTML/CSS code to change the background (1 hour)
			\end{itemize}
			 Total: 10 hours
		\end{itemize}
